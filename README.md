## Features

- **Dynamic List Display:** üìã As you click on the input field, a list of items dynamically appears.
- **Real-time Filtering:** üîç While typing, the list shows only items that match your input.
- **Chip Creation on Click:** üß© Clicking on an item turns it into a chip displayed at the top.
- **Automatic Input Adjustment:** üîÑ The input field adjusts automatically as items become chips.
- **Exclusion from List:** üö´ Once an item becomes a chip, it is removed from the list.
- **Chip Removal:** ‚ùå Each chip comes with an "X" icon; clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.
- **Backspace Highlighting:** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è When the input is blank, pressing backspace highlights the last chip (e.g., Nick Giannopoulos).
- **Backspace Deletion:** ‚èÆÔ∏è On subsequent backspaces, the highlighted chip gets deleted.
- **User-friendly Interaction:** üñ±Ô∏è Intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.
- **Efficient Chip Management:** üîÑ Manage and interact with chips efficiently for a streamlined experience.


## Planning

I conducted extensive research before beginning the project. This involved exploring various existing solutions and conducting Google searches. To gather inspiration and ideas, I looked at Gmail Compose mail feature, Other libraries components, and other designs on Dribbble.

To organize my thoughts and concepts, I used different tools such as Excalidraw for drawing layouts and mapping out ideas. Figma was also helpful in designing custom logos and graphics for the project. 


## Clone the Repository:
